        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/4 cups quick-cooking oats</li>
            <li>1 cup white whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsweetened applesauce</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter (melted and cooled)</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flour, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine the applesauce, butter, egg, vanilla, and honey. Whisk until blended. 
                Pour the liquid mixture into the flour mixture and stir just until combined. The dough will be wet 
                and sticky. Fold in the chocolate chips, raisins, and walnuts. Place in the refrigerator and let chill 
                for at least 30 minutes or up to 3 days.</li>
            <li>When ready to bake, place a rack in the center of your oven and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. 
                Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet. Remove the dough 
                from the refrigerator (if it is very stiff, you may need to let it sit out for 5 to 10 minutes). With 
                a cookie scoop or spoon, drop the dough into 1 1/2-inch balls and arrange on the baking sheet, leaving 
                1 inch of space around each. With your fingers, gently flatten each cookie to be about 3/4-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Bake until the cookies are golden and firm around the edges and set on top, about 9 to 10 minutes. 
                Place the baking sheet on a wire rack and let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, 
                then transfer the cookies to the rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
